BuildStream Documentation
=========================

About BuildStream
-----------------
BuildStream is a flexible and extensible framework for the modelling of build
pipelines in a declarative YAML format, written in python.

These pipelines are composed of abstract elements which perform mutations on
*filesystem data* as input and output, and are related to eachother by their
dependencies.
