.SH NAME
bst\-artifact\-push \- Push a built artifact
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bst artifact push
[OPTIONS] [ELEMENTS]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Push a built artifact to a remote artifact cache.
.PP
The default destination is the highest priority configured cache. You can
override this by passing a different cache URL with the `--remote` flag.
.PP
If bst has been configured to include build trees on artifact pulls,
an attempt will be made to pull any required build trees to avoid the
skipping of partial artifacts being pushed.
.PP
Specify `--deps` to control which artifacts to push:
.PP

    none:  No dependencies, just the element itself
    all:   All dependencies
