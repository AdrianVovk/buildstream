  strip-commands:

  # TODO: Make idempotent when files are hardlinks
  # Strip all ELF binary files that are executable or named like a library.
  # .so files for C, .cmxs for OCaml and .node for Node.
  #
  # The file name and permissions checks are done with the `find` command before
  # the ELF header is checked with the shell command, because it is a lot cheaper
  # to check the mode and file name first, because it is a metadata check, rather
  # than a subprocess and a file read.
  #
  # `file` is not used, to keep the dependency requirements down.
