# A queue which fetches element sources
#
# Args:
#    recalculate (bool): Whether to forcefully recalculate cache consistency
#                        this is necessary when tracking the pipeline first so
#                        that we can reliably skip fetching elements which have
#                        a consistent cache as a result of tracking (which is
#                        not a requirement for tracking).
